### Relief Pitcher Prediction Model 

* **Data used**

	The Situational_Pitching directory contains FanGraphs relief pitcher data from 2015 through 2023

 	Data is split up across innings, number of outs, and the amount of runners on base

* **Running the code**

  	This is a simple Python notebook file that I created with Jupyter notebook
